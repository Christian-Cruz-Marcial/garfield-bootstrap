                        Garfield was born on June 19, 1978, in the kitchen of Mamma Leoni's Italian Restaurant to his mother and 
                        his unnamed father, weighing 5 lbs and 6 ounces at birth. Lasagna has been Garfield's favorite food throughout 
                        his life, unlike the majority of his family, who were more into mice. The restaurant owner of Mamma Leoni's 
                        Italian Restaurant had to choose between keeping Garfield or closing down his restaurant due to a lack of 
                        pasta, so Garfield was sold to a pet shop. On the same day as his birth, Jon Arbuckle came to the pet store 
                        and had to choose between Garfield, an iguana, and a pet rock. On November 14, 1978, comic strip, Jon quoted, 
                        "I love cats. I wanted a cat. So what do I do? I go to the pet store and ask for a cat. What do they give me? 
                        A lasagna with fur and fangs."

                        Garfield is an overweight, anthropomorphic orange tabby cat noted for his sheer laziness, sarcasm, 
                        arrogance, selfishness, and intense passion for food, particularly lasagna and most forms of foods 
                        made from flour. He dislikes raisins and (sometimes) anchovy pizza. Garfield seems to intensely abhore
                        Odie the dog and derives joy from causing him physical harm or insulting him such as kicking him off 
                        tables, seldom showing empathy for the beagle.

                    Garfield comics originally began publication in 1976 under the name <strong>Jon</strong>. The comic quickly became 
                        Insanely popular, nearly immediately gaining nationwide syndication in 1978 under the new name <strong>Garfield</strong>.
                        The comic only grew in popularity as time went on until in 2013 when the Guinness World Records recognized it as the most
                        widely syndicated comic strip in the work, with roughly 2,580 different newspapers and journals publishing the comic weekly
                        to the day. It is estimated that Garfield brings in <strong>$750 million</strong> to <strong>$1 Billion</strong> in merchandise 
                        alone <strong>Every Year!</strong>
